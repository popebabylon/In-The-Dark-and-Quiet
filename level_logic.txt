// user stories

As a player I want the conversations available to me to make sense given my progress through the story.

As a player I want the conversations with new content available to me to be clear in the list so I don't keep clicking on conversations that are empty.

As a player I want to know when a jump in time has occurred so the progress in the story makes sense.

// resources

- VARS and LISTS in ink that can be tested
- functions() that could return values
- conditional choices 

// thoughts

mission status as a list; only goes one way (forward)

function to build the menu based on current state of the story

// check status
	if Prep

		// check if time passing is true
		if news_01 and foo and bar then time passes
		
			display time passes p and adjust status

// build chat menu variables based on status (esp if updated above)

// team chat (possibly have to set VARs at top with default, then go through a few if statements to get to the right result)
	if not tarc_01
		team_chat_link = -> error
		team_chat_text = [faded error text]
	else if foo
		team_chat_link = -> blah
	else
		team_chat_link = -> team_random
		team_chat_text = [faded random text]

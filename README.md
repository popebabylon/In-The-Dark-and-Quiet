# In The Dark and Quiet
 Entry for #GitHubGameOff November 2020 with the theme "moonshot" by Peter D. Johnston.


An old friend (or frenemy) has roped you into a wild scheme at his exciting startCorp, one that will change the face of the solar system (or so he claims).

The project on track, sus out the risks, and discover what someone might do to escape...

in the dark and quiet.

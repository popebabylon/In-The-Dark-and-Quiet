Hollah { pronouner("choi", "chai", "chen") }! # CLASS: benton

Can't believe you're here! # CLASS: benton

* Hey, B! # CLASS: player

* Hi?[]  I can't quite believe it myself. # CLASS: player

* Benton.[]  Why am I here? # CLASS: player

- Oh, { pronouner("choi", "chai", "chen") }, there is so much to catch up on!  How long has it been? # CLASS: benton

* [A couple months?]  You dropped out a couple months back, after drinks in Tortuga. # CLASS: player

* It's been a while.[] SolWare failed in... { date_year - 6 }? # CLASS: player

* A decade.[]  And then you drop this on me out of the blue. # CLASS: player

* You didn't answer my question. # CLASS: player

- Sorry, sorry, been cray cray for a while now.  Look, you're here coz there's few people I trust in the world, and for what it's worth you're one of them. # CLASS: benton

You'll tell me what's what and keep me on the tightrope.  You're no sycho. # CLASS: benton

You've probably read the newsDrops, but Nth Horizon is full throttle. # CLASS: benton

* This is your company? # CLASS: player

    Yeah.  As much as a startCorp can be any one person's. # CLASS: benton

* Congratulations[.], nice to be thought of when the going is good. # CLASS: player

    Yeah. # CLASS: benton
    
    Well. # CLASS: benton
    
* Can I expect a crash landing? # CLASS: player

    Kinda what I'm hoping you help me avoid. # CLASS: benton

* { Business >= 30 } startCorps come and go.  Your angle might be bad and you burn up. # CLASS: player

    Yeah. # CLASS: benton
    
    You always shoot cold, hard reality. # CLASS: benton

- The thing is, this is my baby.  I bootstrapped from inside the gravity well and we're charting just fine. # CLASS: benton

Our tech is the bleeding edge, real nextGen stuff.  Revolutionary. # CLASS: benton

But if I can't turn the next corner then the board and Junia are gonna listen to Goliath's offers. # CLASS: benton

* Going big, huh?[]  Aren't they like _the_ megacorp? # CLASS: player

* Selling out[.] for a big megacorp payday, huh? # CLASS: player

* Sounds like you.[]  Cutting anyone out of the payday? # CLASS: player

- Hey, an exit would treat me nice, that's sure.  But I did't build this company just to be swallowed up by a black hole. # CLASS: benton

We're on course to change the face of the system. # CLASS: benton

Neptune in months.  Out to the Oort in only a year or two.  Look, I don't wanna brag but what we've got is the *goods*. # CLASS: benton

I don't need to be a lackey to a megacorp.  We could level the playing field and get a cushy enough paycheck to enjoy it. # CLASS: benton

* { Business >= 30} Not Goliath sized.[]  If what you have is so hot why aren't they already doing a knock-down-takeover? # CLASS: player
    
    They're trying.  I can hold my own. # CLASS: benton
    
    For now. # CLASS: benton

* { Astronomy + Engineering >= 30} You're nuts.[]  Saturn's been the limit for a reason.  You're talking order of magnitude faster than the Deep Space Jumpers.   # CLASS: player
    
    I know.  And I mean it. # CLASS: benton
    
    You're like the perfect skeptic to bring on board here.  But trust me, we've done it. # CLASS: benton

* { Psychology + Medicine >= 30 } That's noble of you.[]  I'm no fan of the megacorps but how do you keep your team from breaking? # CLASS: player

    That's why I need your help. # CLASS: benton
    
* { Security + Technology >= 30 } Being bleeding edge [is bad.]makes you a target.  Goliath might not be the only worm trying to riddle your brain. # CLASS: player

    I know.  That's why your brain is here. # CLASS: benton
    
    To help.  Not as a target! # CLASS: benton

* So what's the big secret? # CLASS: player

- A'ight. # CLASS: benton

You know me.  Always playing with startCorps, but none that stuck.  Some sold, I'm not complaining.  But nothing felt like real work.  Nothing that felt like what I'm here to do. # CLASS: benton

I sojourned for a while, thought through the pieces.  Seemed there was a jigsaw that just hadn't been completed. # CLASS: benton

* Took some time to ruminate on the problem. # CLASS: player

    Yeah! # CLASS: benton

* Taking a vacation? # CLASS: player

    If you sick like me I guess! # CLASS: benton

* { Psychology >= 30 } Sounds like a Eureka moment[?] is coming? # CLASS: player

    Hey, I'm telling this tale! # CLASS: benton

- SolWare, Long Night, and FireX had their ups and downs, but none were the whole picture.  Just some edges.  Thought experiment time.  Twist the pieces in your mind, bend 'em, break 'em.  Undo reality until they start to fit. # CLASS: benton

And it did. # CLASS: benton

* Eureka moment. # CLASS: player

- You could extrapolate nav on the hypereclyptic if your brainbox can juggle multiple Tsukasa Theorems. # CLASS: benton

You could burn hard enough if life-support is full gel-quarium. # CLASS: benton

Could drop _m_ if we had to, if we weren't trying to haul. # CLASS: benton

And you could control & comm with q-sats, even all the way to the edge. # CLASS: benton

* Are you speaking crazy? # CLASS: player

    No, { pronouner("choi", "chai", "chen") }. # CLASS: benton

* Are you crazy? # CLASS: player

    Always have been! # CLASS: benton

* You're crazy. # CLASS: player

    Not as crazy as you think. # CLASS: benton

* { Engineering + Astronomy >= 50 } The math to pull all that is crazy. # CLASS: player

    We're talking 6th level multi-dimensional sot, that's sure. # CLASS: benton

* { Technology >= 50 } That's some crazy parallel processing[.], even in a controlled lab! # CLASS: player

    Don't think TARC could handle it? # CLASS: benton

* { Business + Psychology >= 50 } Who's crazy enough to try that? # CLASS: player

    Me. # CLASS: benton
    
    And Junia. # CLASS: benton

- I knew it could be done.  I knew we could weave these elements together.  Go startCorp, super-agile, small.  Stay independent.  Avoid getting trapped in the ice-haul, small thinking big money trap. # CLASS: benton

* Nth Horizon is the result?[]  When does the idea become reality? # CLASS: player

    It already has. # CLASS: benton
    
* To what end?[]  Build the smallest space empire possible? # CLASS: player

    Heh.  Nah. # CLASS: benton

* So you've got another wild idea[.] and investors wacky enough to give you the dosh? # CLASS: player

    It's much more than an idea now. # CLASS: benton

- Small and nimble to prove the _tech_ # CLASS: benton

Small and nimble to go under the radar _until_ you're ready # CLASS: benton

THEN go big. # CLASS: benton

Moonshot is our big unveiling.  We show the system what we can do and we'll have everyone banging on our door for the specs. # CLASS: benton

* I still don't know what Moonshot _is_ # CLASS: player

TODO: player might know what moonshot is if they read news first...

- Prove the tech by taking it out for the ultimate spin. # CLASS: benton

I'm flying to Pluto. # CLASS: benton

And back. # CLASS: benton

* What?  Wow! # CLASS: player

* You[?]'re flying to Pluto? # CLASS: player

* You.  Are.  Crazy.[] # CLASS: player

- Modelling has it down to 16 months.  Bit longer for the return trip. # CLASS: benton

We've been building and testing Lowell's Horizon on Luna for the last 3 years.  And now it's ready to roar. # CLASS: benton

* You're on the moon? # CLASS: player

- Yeah.  Astro, Eng, Medsci, and some other departments are all here.  I was splitting time with Terra, but now gotta quarantine before go-time. # CLASS: benton

* When do we leave? # CLASS: player

    Oh. # CLASS: benton
    
* How big is the crew? # CLASS: player

* [I'm not going.]  You can't expect me to go to space! # CLASS: player

- 

Uh, no. # CLASS: benton

Lowell's Horizon is small, single-occupant.  Junia likes to call it my coffin. # CLASS: benton

* You're going on your own?[]  For 3 years? # CLASS: player

    Not exactly. # CLASS: benton

* She's probably not wrong.[]  You'll die of boredom on a trip that long. # CLASS: player

- That's why I wanted you. # CLASS: benton

Sure, I got all the medtech and psitech and infotainment a sot could want on a 3 year deep-space voyage. # CLASS: benton

But I wanted someone I could talk to.  Someone I could be real with. # CLASS: benton

And you're the only person I could think would keep me sane.  Who I could trust. # CLASS: benton

* I'm honored. # CLASS: player

    Thank you. # CLASS: benton

* Hey, we're cool, choi. # CLASS: player

    Cucumber. # CLASS: benton

* Keep you sane?[]  I'm gonna kill you. # CLASS: player

    If gravity doesn't first. # CLASS: benton

- I know this is a dumbo drop, so take a process cycle.  I don't need you to be my therapist today. # CLASS: benton

newsDrops should be going live with our announcement soon.  And you could intro yourself to the exec team.  Junia and Lucas are the other arms of the trifecta. # CLASS: benton

    Doing everything from inside a tank sucks. # CLASS: benton

    A brighter future? # CLASS: benton
    
    I know that sounds corny, but I mean it. # CLASS: benton

    A scary future. # CLASS: benton
    
    The homogeonization of human industry under a Goliath banner. # CLASS: benton

* Just keep running, huh? # CLASS: player

- Everything I've ever done has had the same engine. # CLASS: benton

The tech, the power, the money.  It's all full throttle.  But I wanna use it to change the status quo. # CLASS: benton

We need to get out from under the megas and see independent innovation, independent pioneers, independent spirit.  See the wild ideas and the epic burnouts. # CLASS: benton

That's the only way we evolve enough to survive. # CLASS: benton

* Grand. # CLASS: player

    Or naive. # CLASS: benton

* Risky. # CLASS: player

    I don't think any worthy vision can be otherwise. # CLASS: benton

    You do a lot of crayz things, make bold moves. # CLASS: player

    You're pulling another stunt. # CLASS: player

    There we were, a budding wunderking and { career }, taking on the world! # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "an astronomer" or Astronomy >= 30 } I had plotted [correctly...]the correct vector paths, but _someone_ was tripping and taking us on a wild chase across the Russian Directorate.  Wouldn't take "it's sorted" for an answer.  In the end we're in this massive argument with an ancient radioastronomer who kept trying to steer you wrong (and who didn't speak much Englo or Espro) and we were gonna commit this huge program to the decreped machinery that I was sure was gonna result in a segfault and blow the chance we had to track the sat. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "an entrepreneur" or Business >= 30 } The deal was all but settled[...] with only some blood-on-paper and a night of vodka before we'd take the chips back to the safety of the WHD.  And *you* started getting cold feet, worried we'd overcommit or get swindled.  All the time I'm showing you the numbers and saying we're fine! # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "a flight engineer" or Engineering >= 30 } Flight systems had reported green[...] and we were ready to drop into the pipe.  I've got my whole reputation riding on this test and you just wanted to throw your weight around infront of the Nuorins, so you start calling countermands.  I was livid, and the RHD almost lost their minds. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "a hacker" or Security >= 30 } The intel was some juicy paydata[...] sitting on an RHD server hadn't seen a security patch in three months. # CLASS: player
    
        Intel I got you. # CLASS: benton
        
        Yeah, but couldn't do anything with.  So I pull the best 0day we have for something that out-of-date and we waltz in like it's going to be an Ocean's patticake.  Didn't trip the countermeasures until _someone_ got a bit greedy, and we barely escaped with our liberty. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "a coder" or Technology >= 30 } We had a deadline, code commit or bust[...].  There was a non-zero amount of money on the table and this little project had to keep the data sound, beat the Turin test, and come in under 3 petaflops a second.  The team was running dry on stims and low on ideas... except your really bad ones. # CLASS: player
    
        I had to turn the ship around or we were gonna flop. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "a doctor" or Medicine >= 30 }  But you knew next to nothing about Medsci[...] despite trying to turn your hackathon project into the next penicilin.  The conference was the best sales-pitch but we got caught between buyers who _someone_ had overimpressed with features that weren't even scientifically possible.  I think one of them was a mobster.  I think you would have been shot. # CLASS: player
    
        But deciding between medtechers was something I was better at. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "an ethnologist" or Psychology >= 30 }  Your understanding of Russia[ was lacking.]n history, politics, and manners left a lot to be desired, and the funding would dry up without a little smoothing of ruffled feathers.  It took some serious bowing and scraping to undo the faux-pas and get at least a couple of options back on the table. # CLASS: player
    
    * * { career == "an international spy" or violence > 0 } I think we ended up in the back of a bullet-riddled HoverMerc with the lights off careening down the Moskva and all the newsDrops were pasting your face around as a suspect.  If they found you with that case it would've been Siberia... or Europa for you! # CLASS: player
    
        A fate worse than death!  And to make matters worse our options for escape were thinning!  Ahead the lights of a blockade.  The dark trees around us no salvation.  If we tried to lie low the morning sun would rumble us for sure! # CLASS: player

P has to reel Benton in, keep him on the rails # CLASS: benton

Benton gets back in touch, being very off-again / on-again as he contemplates the upcoming success (or at least half-way point) of his mission.  He's apparently aware that he has made it to Pluto and has manic, ecstatic tirades about the fact that he's done it, but these are counterbalanced with further nihilistic, despondent ravings.  Any bad news from home doesn't help his mental state. # CLASS: benton

The PC can use the various knowledge gained, activities completed, history established, and personal insight to help draw Benton back to reality and take some meaningful actions that will change the outcome of the mission. # CLASS: benton

After the historic Pluto flyby, B needs to decide where he belongs # CLASS: benton

Whether or not Benton is still sane, the PC is a friendly ear in an otherwise empty void and he will communicate with them.  If the PC is lucky or good they will have enough support and options available to convince Benton to turn around for the return journey.  But even if he's not completely insane the pull of the great darkness beyond Pluto does give Benton some pause.  The madness of his company and the Earth seem so far away and so alien that staying in the embracing dark forever almost seems like a good idea.  Is he running away or running towards something? # CLASS: benton

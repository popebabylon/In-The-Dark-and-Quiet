What they were planning though, nobody was saying.","\n",{"#":"copy"},"^Rumors abounded that the contracts signed by employees were almost literally signed in blood, and the security systems were near milspec (much of which was likely procured or purloined by Saari from his previous ventures).  This aura of mystery did nothing to curtail speculation and wonder, but attentions wavered as the black hole of information remained silent for nigh on 4 years.","\n",{"#":"copy"},"^That all changed today with the press release from Nth Horizon announcing their Moonshot Project.  An ambitious stunt has been devised in which Mr. Saari will attempt to be the first person ever to reach the outer solar system, launching from the private facility here on Luna this year onboard Lowell's Horizon.  The single-occupant vessel boasts a number of wildly touted technologies the secretive company has pioneered that will, it is claimed, allow Saari to rocket out to Pluto and around the dwarf planet in record time.","\n",{"#":"copy"},"^\"Nth Horizon is way beyond cutting edge,\" claimed Saari, \"we're on course to change the face of the system.\"","\n",{"#":"copy"},"^\"With the right combination of engineering prowess and data processing, we can guarantee transit to Neptune in months, Pluto in a year and a half, and the Oort in only three to five.
